This repository presents the Predictive Analysis conducted for my Major Research Project titled "A Deep Learning Approach to Forecast the Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) Using Encoder-Decoder Attention Mechanisms and Hybrid Convolutional-LSTM Network". 
The primary objective of the project is to forecast the Canadian CPI using deep learning techniques such as encoder-decoder attention mechanisms and Hybrid Convolutional LSTM. 
The repository stores code for exploratory data analysis, modelling using unsupervised and deep learning techniques
